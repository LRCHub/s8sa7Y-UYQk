Ooh

I'ma hold you, hold me down
Over you somebody,
catch a beat down
We ten toes, two feet down
We down
Yeah, we down (Yeah, yeah)
Down (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, we down (Yeah, yeah)
Down, yeah
Ooh, my last, I'll split it
Partner in crime, I'm wit it
I'll tell the judge I did it
Just put something
on my books, come visit
I know you would do the same
for me
I know that if anybody came
for me
I know it ain't a thang to bang
for me
Need you to know that
it's the same for me
More than a homie
Don't nobody know me
better than you
How to get me back together
like you
When I fall apart
like I always do
I ain't never not knew who
to run to
Baby, that's you
Ooh, riding with me
since day one, go
Always there when I need you so
Run this song back
and know for sure that
We down
Shotgun in the whip, seat down
See you whenever
they see me 'round
We ten toes, two feet down
We down (We down)
We down (Yeah, yeah)
Down (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, we down (Yeah, yeah)
Down (Yeah, yeah) ooh
We down (We down)
I'ma hold you hold me down
Over you somebody
catch a beat down
We ten toes, two feet down
We down
Yeah, we down (Yeah, yeah)
Down (Yeah, yeah)
Baby we down, yeah yeah
Down, yeah
(I got you, I said I got you)
Stay down ten toe-oh-oh-oes
Say the word,

Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Stay down ten toe-oh-oh-oes
Say the word,

Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Ten toes (Toes)
Stand on all ten (All ten)
from the back
Make her do a backbend (Back)
I know she love me
'Cause I got the racks in
(Racks)
Come give me head
'til I'm crashing
You know you look good to me
(Know you look good to me)
Come pull up in the hood wit me
(Come pull up in the hood)
It ain't no limit
Get to swiping, mm-mm
I'ma ice you out
and I have you icy, mm-mm
Please sell the digits
just like you triflin', mm-mm
I told her be nasty wit me
Please don't be classy wit me
Know you got class in a week
But you gon' stay over
Stay down
and I might get you a makeover
Stay down ten toe-oh-oh-oes
Say the word lemme know-oh-oh-oh
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Ooh, say something
Say something like we dirty
and the jakes coming
If you loyal, hit the jeweler,
have him make something
Let you whip the G-Wagon or
the Wraith some-
(Take one) Fake!
Not something
they can say about you
Even if the breast ain't real
I know the heart so true
And you a thug all day
And I got love all day
Legal and crime, hit my line
And I'm on my way, ayy
Bet I jump first
if you ever say jump
Bet I got yo back so much,
I'm in the front
Long as you shotgun,
pistol, grip, pump, yeah
That mean let me tell you,
I'ma stay down
Stay down ten toe-oh-oh-oes
(Say the word) Say the word,
lemme know-oh-oh-oh
(Call me)
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
(It's a go, it's a go)
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
Baby, I'ma stay down
Stay down ten toe-oh-oh-oes
(Hey, say the word)
Say the word lemme know-oh-oh-oh
(Call me)
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
(It's a go, it's a go, ayy)
Call me and it's a go-oh-oh-oh
